# What is this?
This project was created to fufill an assignment for my Object-Oriented Programming course at Quinnipiac University. After learning the concepts and techniques of object-oriented programming using Java Swing, students were required to develop an app fufilling specific requirements.

# Avoid Enemies
*Avoid Enemies* is an game application where the player's objective is to avoid the enemy NPC to win. The application is designed so the player can choose between 3 predetermined avatars, the number of enemies they want to avoid, and the difficulty of the game.
